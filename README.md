Granular Systems
This repo has some papers and my Thesis on experimental studies of 2D granular systems using photoelastic disks. 
The thesis solves the highly complicated and (at that time) seemingly intractable inverse problem of finding all the interparticle contact forces from polarized imaged of stressed photoelastic particles. This work was published in Nature, PRL, and other journals.
